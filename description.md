You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.

Have you ever asked yourself how a framework works?
 
var task = 
  { 
      "framework": “Building a framework is a good way to deepen your 
                   JavaScript and programming knowledge because it 
                   forces you to explore language features and software 
                   engineering principles.”
      "done":       "We will build a framework and expand our JavaScript knowledge."
  }
  
  
```
